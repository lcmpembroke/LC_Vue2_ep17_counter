## General info
This code follows episode 17 of Laracasts Learn Vue 2 Step by Step. 
Demonstrates hot module replacement.  
It shows a quick counter component imported into the main Vue app to demonstrate that when making changes using hot reloading it doesn't affect data already updated within the app. So the counter will stay at whatever value it left off.


## Setup
* Clone the repository from git and cd into the project directory

## Build Setup
``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

Browser should open at localhost:8080
